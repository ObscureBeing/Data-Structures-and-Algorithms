Answer 1: The heights of the resultant trees are less than the binary search trees(BST) with same input values. 
          Therefore, these trees are more balanced and efficient for the input data given as compared to BST.

Answer 2: Complixity of algorithms as compared to BST
          Alorithms done in these activities: best case O(logN), worst case O(logN)
          Binary Search Tree: best case O(logN), worst case O(N)

Answer 3: 2-3-4 trees implementation will be easier to implement as compared to red black trees.
          We can easily convert 2-3-4 trees to red black trees by following the conversion rules.

Answer 4: In red black trees, in order traversal will be in the order left-root-right of their elements.
          In B trees, first visit the left child then root and then continue traversal.
          Similary with 2-3-4 trees, the traversal will begin from left node-root-right of the tree.
